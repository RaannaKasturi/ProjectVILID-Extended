# Project VILID (Extended)

This project is planned to be the extended version of the earlier one, VILID Colabs, https://github.com/RaannaKasturi/VILID-Colabs, which was the part of Project VILID, one of the modification based project from my pre-github phase and whose source codes are nowhere to be found. 
In short and sweet. This, Project VILID (Extended) is the extension of Project VILID and it encompasses more features and much better ones.

## Project VILID (Extended) will be -
- Much more fun to use

- Encapsulated with much more features and tools
- And, most of all, it'll be free. (Registration might be compulsory, post-completion of the project and final deployment)
